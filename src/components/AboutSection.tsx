                I'm a big enthusiast of frontend development with basic knowledge of Javascript, Typescript, React, Tailwind CSS 
                (using it for the very first time in this project!), and some other libraries. I've been studying for a couple of years
                now, recieving a diploma as a web developer in the process and looking forward to finish my career soon.

                I'm also a big enthusiast of design and animation, and it's on my plans to learn more about it in the future! <br />
                (Unrelated, but i also love videogames, so if we don't get to work together, we could play something instead! haha)
